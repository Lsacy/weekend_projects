The "game" I have created is a random number generator.

First I have imported the library "random"

Then I have defined all the possible charaters which can be used for the generation of the password.

Next a while loop with exception handling is used for user input, where the user input is limited a string with a length between 8-16

Finally a function called gen_pass() is defined to generate the random password with the length defined by user input.

gen_pass() function is called in the end and a value is shown.
